Over the last years, my research activities have focused on proposing solutions based on artificial intelligence, advanced control, and real-time optimization to address problems in chemical processes. The main objective has been to integrate these solutions into concise cyberspace and interconnect them with the physical space formed by the chemical units. Therefore, providing practical solutions for the new industrial paradigms. To do so, the research under development is listed in five main branches as:

  - **Artificial Intelligence-based Modelling, Simulation, and Forecast** have the specific objective of developing AI solutions to solve processes issues, such as simulation, prediction, soft sensors, and fault detection, thus providing a reliable source of real-time information about the process.
  - **Advanced Process Control** covers the development of controllers for systems with periodic behavior, as is the case of cyclic adsorption processes, with guaranteed stability and stable integration concerning the Real-time Optimization layer. Furthermore, model uncertainty is included using robust formulations, and controllers’ interface with Artificial Intelligence solution is evaluated.
  - **Processes Optimization** concerns the development of solutions for real-time economic optimization of cyclic adsorption separation processes. The focus is to develop a methodology for implementing RTO formulations (single or multi-objective) for cyclic adsorption units based on the AI surrogate models, coupled with those industrial units' safety, economic, and environmental constraints. 
  - **Processes and Digitalization** deal with the development of solutions for automation of chemical units and the development of software/hardware to promote the integration between the other branches of my researcher and the physical processes. It focuses on consolidating concise cyber-physical systems and exploring their potentialities through their cloning into digital twins.
  - **Uncertainty Evaluation** covers the evaluation and integration of the uncertainty sources. Its focus ranges from the modeling level to the practical issues related to chemical processes to develop. It aims at the determination of trustworthy, reliable, and precise models. It considers the uncertainty evaluation as an essential tool that allows the model identification and validation to be made with a low number of experiments while leading to high precision predictions
